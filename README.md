# Quno!

Quno is a digital version of the classic card game UNO ‚Äî with a twist. Every game is shuffled using **true quantum randomness**, not just pseudorandom functions. This makes Quno the first online UNO-style game to use actual quantum mechanics to influence gameplay.

## üîç What is This?

Quno is a single-player browser game (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) where you play against a computer opponent. The game uses a real-world **quantum random number generator (QRNG)** from the **Australian National University (ANU)** to shuffle the deck.

This means that the outcome of every game is not just "random" in the computer science sense ‚Äî it's **physically random**, derived from unpredictable quantum events.
